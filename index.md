# Overview

Pat is an easy to use pub/sub wrapper for the azure service bus. It's free to use and open source.

The guides in [getting started](docs/) should cover most of what you need, if not come on over our [github repo](https://github.com/Purplebricks/pat) and ask your questions.

Pat is constructed from a few working pieces. If you've been through the getting started guides and the detail wasn't there, then take a look through:

 - [Pat.Subscriber](docs/pat-subscriber.html)
 - [Pat.Sender](docs/pat-sender.html)
 - [Pat.Subscriber.Tools](docs/pat-subscriber-tools.html)
 - [Pat.Sender.DataProtectionEncryption](docs/pat-sender-dataprotectionencryption.html)
 - [Pat.DataProtection](docs/pat-dataprotection.html)
 - [Pat.Sender](docs/pat-sender.html)
